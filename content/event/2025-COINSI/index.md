summary: "We successfully developed a pipeline to ingest and standardize Quechua linguistic data into Wikidata. The integration of Quechua into the Common Voice platform has yielded significant quantitative results for speech technology development."
abstract: "Our 4-phase lifecycle (Creation, Hosting, Curation, and Deployment) was validated as a scalable model for other under-resourced languages. The results confirm that Knowledge Graphs are not just for Big Tech. By providing a structured architecture, we empower indigenous communities with Data Sovereignty."
