summary: "This research provides a roadmap for transforming fragmented linguistic data into a formal architecture that supports search engines, translation tools, and educational apps."
abstract: "This research addresses the critical need for Digital Language Sovereignty by proposing a specialized framework for building KGs for under-resourced languages. We present a task-based lifecycle creation, hosting, curation, and deployment, where we demonstrate how structured semantic data can mitigate the scarcity of training resources for minority languages."
