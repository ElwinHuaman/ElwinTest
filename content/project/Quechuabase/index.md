## Our Mission
[Quechuabase.org](https://quechuabase.org/) is an open-source, community-driven digital effort dedicated to the preservation, documentation, and revitalization of the Quechua language family. By leveraging modern database architecture and collaborative linguistics, we aim to provide a centralized hub for researchers, educators, and native speakers to access high-quality linguistic data.

## The Problem
Despite being the most widely spoken indigenous language family in the Americas, Quechua suffers from digital under-representation. Fragmented dialects, inconsistent orthography, and a lack of structured datasets make it difficult for developers to build effective AI tools, translation software, or educational apps.

## Our Approach
[Quechuabase.org](https://quechuabase.org/) serves as a Linguistic Data Knowledge Graph. Our project features:

* Knowledge Graph: A searchable knowledge base mapping variations between Southern, Central, and Northern Quechua.
* Corpus Architecture: A curated collection of written texts and transcribed sentences for Natural Language Processing (NLP) training.
* Open API: A gateway for developers to integrate Quechua vocabulary and grammar rules into responsible applications.
* Community Validation: A "wiki-style" verification layer where native speakers can validte and refine entries to ensure cultural and linguistic accuracy.

## How to contribute
> 🚀 The Andes go Digital: Introducing Quechuabase.org 🏔️

Quechua is more than a language; it is a worldview. But in the world of Big Data and AI, indigenous voices are often left behind.

> We’re changing that.

Introducing [Quechuabase.org](https://quechuabase.org/), the first comprehensive, open-source knowledge base designed to power the next generation of Quechua digital tools. 

Whether you are a linguist, a developer, or a Quechua enthusiast, our platform is built for you.

## Some Results in 2025
We have successfully integrated Puno Quechua into the global Common Voice ecosystem. The contributed datasets are categorized into two primary types:

### Reading (Scripted) Speech: 
This portion of the dataset consists of volunteers reading aloud a set of pre-approved, CCO-licensed sentences.
- Corpus Size: We collected and uploaded 2,065 sentences for the platform, which represents 11.6% of the total Quechua sentences available on Common Voice.
- Objective: These recordings are made in noise-free environments with clear pronunciation to provide high-quality training data for standard voice applications.

### Spontaneous Speech: 
This represents a more advanced contribution type designed to capture how the language is used in real-world, casual conversation.
- Methodology: We uploaded 150 open-ended questions specifically focused on the Agricultural and Food domain for community members to answer freely.
- Linguistic Features: These recordings capture natural speaking patterns, including accents, hesitations, repetitions, and interjections such as "mm" and "ahh".
- Code-Switching Mitigation: To minimize the frequent mixing of Quechua and Spanish (code-switching), we encouraged and centered these topics around culturally vibrant subjects like farming and daily life.
